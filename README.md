## Overview

OpenResponses revolutionizes how developers build AI applications by providing a comprehensive, production-ready toolkit with essential enterprise features—all through an elegantly simplified API interface. Stop cobbling together disparate tools and start building what matters.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Run OpenResponses locally to access an OpenAI-compatible API that works seamlessly with multiple model providers and supports unlimited tool integrations. Deploy a complete AI infrastructure on your own hardware with full data sovereignty.

### Run with Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 masaicai/open-responses:latest
```

### Using with OpenAI SDK

```python
openai_client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), default_headers={'x-model-provider': 'openai'})

response = openai_client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="Write a poem on Masaic"
)
```

### Using with OpenAI Agent SDK

```python
client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), default_headers={'x-model-provider': 'openai'})
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a humorous poet who can write funny poems of 4 lines.",
    model=OpenAIResponsesModel(model="gpt-4o-mini", openai_client=client)
)
```

### Using with cURL

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/v1/responses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY' \
--header 'x-model-provider: openai' \
--data '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "stream": false,
    "input": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a poem on Masaic"
        }
    ]
}'
```
