**AgC** is the open-core platform that powers **Open Agentic Compute** — a new compute substrate purpose-built for deploying, running, and orchestrating AI agents at scale.

AgC treats agents as first-class compute units. Think of it as what EC2 did for VMs — but for agents. Modular, observable, cloud-neutral, and production-ready.

## 🚀 What is Open Agentic Compute?

**Open Agentic Compute** is an open infrastructure layer designed for the age of intelligent, autonomous systems. It provides:

- ⚙️ A pluggable **Agent Runtime**
- 🧠 Integrated **Memory Systems** (long-term, episodic, vector)
- 🪄 Dynamic **Model Routing** (multi-LLM support)
- 🔁 Multi-agent **Orchestration**
- 📈 Built-in **Tracing & Observability**
- 🧪 Sandboxed **Testing & Replay**
- 🔐 **Security, control, and modular governance**

All of this is delivered in a fully deployable platform with a single goal:
> **Empower developers and organizations to run agents like cloud-native workloads — at scale, and without lock-in.**

## 💬 What Engineers Are Saying

> "Masaic OpenResponses is one of the few platforms that supports the `/responses` API even when the backend (like Ollama) **doesn't — but might in the future**. It handles server-side tools like search and supports stateful agent processing — two huge wins. Bonus: it even integrates with OpenTelemetry out of the box. The team is responsive and fast-moving."
